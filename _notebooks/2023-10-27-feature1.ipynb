    "# Initial Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "As I took responsibility of developing and scheming the CSCanvasHub, I went and used design programs like Figma, which helped me envision of what the student would need to see when logging in. After detailed conversations with Mr. Mortensen, he emphasized the need for the student to use the original CS blog post to retain to if they had some issue, however, access was an issue, and therefore the requirement of our new idea being disruptive yet also having the original source being integrated came up.  The initial requirement was to create an \"Assignment Selector\" web page where users could select a week and view the corresponding assignment details in an iframe. The page was designed with a simple layout, using the Roboto font for a clean appearance. The assignments for each week were hard-coded into a JavaScript object, and the iframe would load the content based on the selected week.\n",

    "# Enhancement - Freeform Iframe Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon review, it was suggested to make the iframe \"freeform\", meaning users should have the option to view or hide the iframe content. This was achieved by adding a toggle button with a blue arrow. When clicked, this button would either display or hide the iframe. The arrow would also change direction to indicate the current state of the iframe (collapsed or expanded). This was because after consulting with Mr. Mortensen, it seemed clear that he didn't want the user to be suddenly flashed with another copy of his blog. Because of this, I decided to give the user to option on if they wanted to view the iFrame or not, allowing them to have total control and access of what they wanted.\n",

    "uring the development of the MortCanvas Assignment Selector, one of the primary challenges faced was ensuring the seamless integration of dynamic content loading. The iframe, which was responsible for displaying the assignment details, occasionally failed to load the intended content. Similarly, there were instances where the metadata associated with a particular week did not render as anticipated. These inconsistencies posed a significant challenge, as they directly impacted the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying the Problem:\n",
    "The first step in addressing these issues was to pinpoint the exact nature of the problem. Was the iframe not loading due to an incorrect URL? Was the metadata not displaying because of a misconfiguration in the data structure or a flaw in the rendering logic?"
