## üí≠ Passion Project: Disrupting Healthcare with AI
I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to disrupt the healthcare industry. My current focus is on developing a mobile app for healthcare reviews, integrating user-friendly features and reliable information. I'm also exploring the fascinating world of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). My goal is to create an AI application that enhances classroom productivity, addressing challenges I've personally faced. This journey into AI is not just a venture into a cutting-edge field but also a personal quest to improve learning experiences for many like me.
