As we navigate the intricate world of backend computing, our project, MortCanvas.org, stands as a testament to collaborative learning and a passion for development. This journey, embarked upon with my talented colleagues Rohin Sood, Vardaan Sinha, and Vishnu Aravind, has been nothing short of enlightening, filled with challenges, brainstorming sessions, and significant milestones.

Creating a Robust Login Functionality

Our initial focus was establishing a secure and efficient login mechanism. We delved into the complexities behind user authentication, understanding the necessity of security and ease of access. By setting up an API controller, we laid the groundwork necessary for all subsequent interactions between the server and our website. One of our breakthroughs was devising a method allowing the administrator, the backbone of user management, to create a preferred User ID and pin. This customization offered a personalized touch, often lacking in generic login environments.

Building a Comprehensive Data Framework for Students

As our project caters to students across various courses like CSSE, CSP, and CSA, we faced the challenge of creating a unified yet diverse data-framework. Given the absence of a ready-made API, we took the initiative to build from scratch. This framework is designed to accommodate user IDs for every student, a monumental task that required meticulous planning and execution. Our objective is to transform this extensive data into a functional API, instrumental for features like analyzing GitHub statistics at the administrator's convenience.

Enhancing Security with Web Tokens

Security being paramount, Rohin and I have dedicated ourselves to establishing stringent connection and validation protocols for web tokens. This segment of our project demands an in-depth understanding of secure data transmission, ensuring that every piece of information shared between the user and server is encrypted and authenticated. The learning curve is steep, but the knowledge we're acquiring is invaluable.

Streamlining Database Management with CRUD

On the other side, Vardaan and Vishnu have taken on the critical role of refining the backend aspect of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Their focus is to ensure that the administrator can seamlessly update the database, particularly when it involves adding or removing assignments. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the relevance and accuracy of the platform's content.

Deployment and Progress

In terms of deployment, we're making significant strides. Vardaan is in the advanced stages of deploying our project through Amazon Web Services, specifically targeting the Ohio server. This step is pivotal in making MortCanvas.org accessible to users. Currently, we estimate that MortCanvas.org is 45% complete. However, we anticipate reaching an 80% completion rate once the backend is fully operational.

The journey through the backend development of MortCanvas.org has been both challenging and exhilarating. It has taught us the essence of teamwork, the thrill of problem-solving, and the joy of innovation. As we continue, we aim to not only complete our tasks but also to imbibe every lesson that this wonderful journey has to offer. Here's to more coding, more collaboration, and the eventual successful launch of MortCanvas.org!
