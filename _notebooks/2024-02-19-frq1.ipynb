    "For Part A, I used the PokerHandValueCalculator class that calculates the total value of a poker hand which is given in an array of card values. Basically, the handValues array shows a hand of cards using integers, where the card number is from 1-A, and there four shapes: Hearts (H), Clubs (C), Spades (S), and Diamonds (D). The calculateHandValue method sums these values to calculate the total value of the hand. This simplifies the the tough part of poker but serves as a good example of how I modeled a poker system in code using array lists. \n",

The method returns a one-dimensional array with one entry for each row of arr2D such that each entry is the sum of the corresponding row in arr2D. As a reminder, each row of a two-dimensional array is a one-dimensional array.\n"
