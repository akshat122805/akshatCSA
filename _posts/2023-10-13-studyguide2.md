# Hashmaps

A hashmap, also known as a hash table, is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
Importance in Computer Science

Hashmaps are fundamental in computer science because they provide efficient data retrieval. They offer, on average, a time complexity of O(1) for insert, delete, and search operations, making them ideal for high-performance algorithms.
Key Concepts
Hash Function

A hash function takes an input (or 'key') and returns an index into the array, where the corresponding value is stored.

#### Collision Resolution

Since a hash function may produce the same index for more than one key, collision resolution strategies like chaining (linked lists at each array index) or open addressing (probing for the next empty slot) are used.

####  Load Factor

The load factor is a measure that decides when to resize the hashmap. It is calculated by dividing the number of entries by the number of buckets.

#### Rehashing

Rehashing is the process of creating a new, larger array and transferring existing entries to it. This happens when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.

####  Example of Hashmap Usage in Java

java

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("apple", 1);
map.put("banana", 2);

int value = map.get("apple"); // Returns 1

Best Practices

Choose a good hash function to minimize collisions.
Keep the load factor low to maintain efficient operations.

Common Mistakes

Not handling collisions can lead to data loss.
Forgetting to resize the hashmap can lead to poor performance as the number of elements grows.

Other Relevant Computer Science Topics
Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements, all of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

#### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

#### Stacks and Queues

Stacks are abstract data types that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

#### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes.

Graphs

Graphs are collections of nodes or vertices connected by edges and can be used to represent various problems in computer science.

Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for calculations. They are used for data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

#### Big O Notation

Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

#### Sorting Algorithms

Common sorting algorithms include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort, each with different performance characteristics.

#### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms like Binary Search provide mechanisms to efficiently find data within structures.

#### Complexity Analysis

Complexity analysis involves determining the time and space complexity of algorithms, which is critical for understanding their efficiency.
