    "# Explain a POJO and Changes to a POJO\n",
    "\n",
    "## POJO: Plain Old Java Object\n",
    "It is a Java class that adheres to a set of standards to keep a simplistic structure. It does not extend or implement specialized classes or interfaces, which makes it a plain Java object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Fields:\n",
    "These are variables that cannot be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public No-Argument Constructor:\n",
    "This is a constructor which does not take any parameters. It is often used to create an instance of the class with default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getter and Setter Methods:\n",
    "Getter methods allow external classes to retrieve the values of private fields.\n",
    "Setter methods allow external classes to modify those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/diagram1.png\" alt=\"mainscore\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes to a POJO:\n",
    "Adding, modifying, or removing fields, as well as updating methods to reflect the new structure or behavior. It's important to ensure that the changes are backward-compatible if the POJO is used in a serialized or persisted form.\n",

    "CSRF protection, authentication, authorization, CORS support, and JWT token validation\n",

    "1. Pull the latest version of the docker image\n",
    "2. Stop any running containers of the old docker image: docker-compose down\n",
    "3. Remove any old, outdated containers\n",
    "4. Run the new container: docker-compose up -d --build\n",
