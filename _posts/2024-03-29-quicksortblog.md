## Main Reflection

Reflecting on the N@TM Tri 2 presentation of our project, PLACE.com, it's clear that we embarked on an ambitious journey to merge the functionalities of Discord and Outlook into a single, innovative platform. Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) presentation was a crucial milestone, showcasing our initial capabilities such as texting on a channel server, creating a channel server, integrating a customized PLACE.com chatbot, and implementing an image uploader. These features laid the groundwork for a platform that aims to streamline communication and organizational tasks in a novel way.
